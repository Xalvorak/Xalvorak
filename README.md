**C# Developer specializing in operating systems, low-level tools, and artificial intelligence**

## Profile

Experienced developer in computer systems and low-level software architecture. My work focuses on building technical tools, system components, custom kernels, and specialized software architectures.

I primarily use C# within Windows environments, with advanced expertise in memory manipulation, native interoperability (Win32 API), binary structuring, and execution optimization. I also design AI engines intended to run locally, without relying on external services.
